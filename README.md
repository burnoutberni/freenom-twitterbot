freenom-twitterbot
==================

Twitterbot for the melons &amp; meatloaf stand at #ohm2013.

How to install
--------------

* Create new application at http://dev.twitter.com
* Change config.php
* Important! Take care that the users.json and the tweets.log files are in a folder accessible by PHP, but still secure, as they both contain user data to a certain degree.
